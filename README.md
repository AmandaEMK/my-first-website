# My first web page

Welcome to the first web page that I am building as a student of a Web Developer program at Code Institute.

You can view the website by clicking [here](https://amandaemk.github.io/my-first-website/) 

## Project description

The reason for building this web page is to get familiar with web site coding and technologies used for managing sites such as Git, GitHub and Cloud 9.
The project will be a web site introducing the different technologies that I am learning.

## Technology

This website was written using HTML and CSS using the Cloud 9 platform. It is hosted on GitHub Pages.
